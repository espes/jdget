 * Sandboxing Rhino in Java January 2, 2009 – 12:07 am Tags: Java, JavaScript,
 * Security I’ve been working on a Java app which needed Rhino for scripting.
 * The app would need to run untrusted JavaScript code from 3rd parties, so I
 * had to find a way to block access to all Java methods, except the ones I
 * wanted. This would not be a problem if there was an easy way to disable
 * LiveConnect - the feature of Rhino which provides java access to scripts -
 * but there is no such thing.
 * 
 * However, after a lot of digging around, I finally found a way to do this
 * without too much hacking. In fact, it can be done by just extending a few of
 * the Rhino classes, and using the setters provided to override some of the
 * default ones.
 * 
 * 
 * ClassShutter
 * 
 * Let’s first look at the ClassShutter, which can be used to restrict access to
 * Java packages and classes.
 * 
 * //cx is the Context instance you're using to run scripts
 * cx.setClassShutter(new ClassShutter() { public boolean
 * visibleToScripts(String className) { if(className.startsWith("adapter"))
 * return true;
 * 
 * return false; } }); The above will effectively disable access to all Java
 * classes onwards from the point where the shutter was set. However, if you run
 * any scripts before setting the shutter, classes accessed there can still be
 * used! You can use this to your advantage, for example to provide specific
 * classes in the scripts under different names or such.
 * 
 * You probably noticed the comparison to “adapter” in the shutter. This is for
 * when you implement interfaces or extend Java classes. Rhino will create new
 * classes based on those interfaces/classes, and they will be called adapterN,
 * where N is a number. If you block access to classes starting with adapter,
 * you can’t implement or extend, and my use-case required that.
 * 
 * However, there is a limitation in the ClassShutter…
 * 
 * Reflection
 * 
 * As you may know, you can use
 * someInstance.getClass().forName(”some.package.Class”).newInstance() to get a
 * new instance of some.package.Class.
 * 
 * This will not get blocked by the ClassShutter! We need to disable access to
 * getClass() to block this.
 * 
 * While the ClassShutter is relatively well documented, doing this required
 * more research. A post in the Rhino mailing list finally pushed me to the
 * right direction: Overriding certain NativeJavaObject methods and creating a
 * custom ContextFactory and WrapFactory for that.
 * 
 * Here is an extended NativeJavaObject, which blocks access to getClass. You
 * could use this approach to block access to other methods too:
 * 
 * public static class SandboxNativeJavaObject extends NativeJavaObject { public
 * SandboxNativeJavaObject(Scriptable scope, Object javaObject, Class
 * staticType) { super(scope, javaObject, staticType); }
 * 
 * @Override public Object get(String name, Scriptable start) { if
 *           (name.equals("getClass")) { return NOT_FOUND; }
 * 
 *           return super.get(name, start); } } To make the above class work,
 *           you need two more classes:
 * 
 *           A WrapFactory which returns our SandboxNativeJavaObject’s
 * 
 *           public static class SandboxWrapFactory extends WrapFactory {
 * @Override public Scriptable wrapAsJavaObject(Context cx, Scriptable scope,
 *           Object javaObject, Class staticType) { return new
 *           SandboxNativeJavaObject(scope, javaObject, staticType); } } And a
 *           ContextFactory, which returns Context’s which use
 *           SandboxWrapFactory:
 * 
 *           public class SandboxContextFactory extends ContextFactory {
 * @Override protected Context makeContext() { Context cx = super.makeContext();
 *           cx.setWrapFactory(new SandboxWrapFactory()); return cx; } }
 *           Finally, to make all this work, we need to tell Rhino the global
 *           ContextFactory:
 * 
 *           ContextFactory.initGlobal(new SandboxContextFactory()); With this,
 *           we are done. Now, when you use
 *           ContextFactory.getGlobal().enterContext(), you will get sandboxing
 *           contexts. But why did we need to set it globally? This is because
 *           it would appear that certain things, such as the adapter classes,
 *           use the global context factory to get some context for themselves,
 *           and without setting the global factory, they would get unlimited
 *           access.
 * 
 *           In closing
 * 
 *           I hope this is useful for someone. It took me a long time to figure
 *           it all out, so here it is now, all documented in one place. =)
 * 
 *           The mailing list post where I found the direction for blocking
 *           getClass can be found here. Thanks to Charles Lowell.
 * 
 *           There is also the SecurityController, which may be useful in
 *           further securing the class.
 * 
 *           And as a final warning, while this approach works for me, and I
 *           haven’t yet found any way to get past the sandboxing and into
 *           Java-land… but there may be a way, and if you find one, do let me
 *           know.
