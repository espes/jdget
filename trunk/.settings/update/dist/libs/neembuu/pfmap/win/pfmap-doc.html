<h2><a name="pfmap-description"></a>Description</a></h2>


<p>
The Pismo File Mount Audit Package (PFMAP) is a utility
application that utilizes Pismo File Mount technology
to allow users to mount the contents of various types of
archive and image files to the file system as read-write
or read-only folders.
</p>
<p>
In addition to being a useful stand-alone application,
PFMAP is used in conjunction with the Pismo File Mount
Developmenet Kit to integrate Pismo File Mount technology
into other applications, or to develop extensions to
PFMAP to support new file formats.
</p>
<p>
For more information on Pismo File Mount technology or the
Pismo File Mount Development Kit, see the
Pismo Technic Inc. website.

<h2><a name="pfmap-cmd"></a>Command Line</a></h2>


<p>
The command line executable pfm.exe provides a complete
interface to Pismo File Mount. Using pfm.exe it is possible to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount files.</li>
<li>Unmount files.</li>
<li>List mounted files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pfm.exe contains about information and command line help.
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;pfm -h
&gt;pfm mount -h
&gt;pfm mount myphotos.zip
&gt;pfm unmount myphotos.zip
</pre>

<h2><a name="pfmap-control"></a>Mount Control</a></h2>


<p>
The Mount Control application, pfmcontrol.exe, is the graphical
user interface to PFMAP. All functionality in PFMAP can be
accessed through this application, independent of the Explorer
extensions or the PFM command line interface. Mount Control is
particularly useful to view all currently mounted files.
</p>
<p>
Mount Control can be started from the Pismo File Mount Audit Package
folder in the Start menu. When files are mounted, a mount status
icon is displayed in the Explorer notification area. Double clicking
the mount status icon will also launch Mount Control.
</p>

<h2><a name="pfmap-shx"></a>Explorer shell extension</a></h2>


<p>
PFMAP includes an explorer shell extension that allows convenient
control of PFMAP directly from Windows Explorer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Files can be mounted and unmounted through
explorer file and context menus.
</li>
<li>Supported file types are given icons and can be opened by
double clicking the file name in Explorer.
</li>
<li>New <a href=#pfmap-pfolder>Private Folders</a> can be created
through the Explorer file/new menu.
</ul>

<h2><a name="pfmap-isofs"></a>CD/DVD image file reader</a></h2>


<p>
PFMAP includes a CD/DVD image file reader. This allows reading
and executing files stored in CD/DVD images without having to
first burn the images to media.
</p>
<p>
The CD/DVD image file reader supports all or part of the following
file system and image container formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO-9660
</li>
<li>Joliet extensions (Windows Unicode file names)
</li>
<li>ISO-9660:1999 (UTF8 file names)
</li>
<li>UDF 1.02
</li>
<li>ISO images
</li>
<li>Compact ISO images
</li>
<li>Compact File Set
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="pfmap-zipfs"></a>ZIP reader</a></h2>


<p>
PFMAP includes a ZIP archive file reader. This allows reading
and executing ZIP file contents without having to first extract
the contents to the local hard drive.
</p>
<p>
The ZIP reader supports the following formats and compression
modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pkzip 2.0 file format
</li>
<li>64 bit file size extensions
</li>
<li>Deflate compression
</li>
<li>Deflate64 compression
</li>
<li>Bzip2 compression
</li>
<li>Lzma compression
</li>
<li>UTF8 file names
</li>
<li>Unix ZIP file support (non DOS/OEM file names)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
The ZIP reader is missing the following potentially useful
features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pkzip 2.0 password protection
</li>
<li>Winzip AES encryption extension
</li>
<li>Pkware encryption extensions
</li>
<li>Non-standard/advanced compression algorithms
(ppmd, wavpack, ...)
</li>
<li>Legacy compression algorithms (shrink, implode, ...)
</ul>

<h2><a name="pfmap-pfolder"></a>Private Folder file system</a></h2>


<p>
Using PFMAP, Private Folders can be created and used to
store sensitive files. The contents of Private Folders can
only be accessed after providing the correct password.
</p>
<p>
Private Folders utilize strong industry standard algorithms
to encrypt data and handle passwords.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the encrypted file support provided in Windows,
Private Folders are not bound to a single system or user
logon. Private Folders can be freely copied and moved
between systems while locked. Once opened they appear as
a normal folder with full compatibility with all applications.
</p>
<p>
Unlike encrypted archive products, sensitive files are not
written to the users hard disk when they are accessed.
</p>
<p>
Private Folders can optionally use data compression to
increase storage efficiency.
